Construct an interactive navigation menu that modifies its color or appearance in response to scrolling or lingering over an item. Every page should display the navigation menu in the same location. Use CSS to style the menu, HTML to organize it, and JavaScript to add interactivity. For example, you may use JavaScript to change the menu's background or font color when it scrolls or when a menu item is hovered over.
